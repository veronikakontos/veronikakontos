### Hi there! My name is Veronika Kontos 
#### I'm a Full-stack Developer who is truly passionate about making open-source accessible, creating technology to elevate people, share ideas and building commmunity. My favorites technologies/languages I have been working with include ReactJS, MySql, Flask, MongoDb, Spring... I am ready and excited to excel my skills to the next level with knowledge and experiences with HTML5, CSS, Python, Java, MERN(mongo, express,react, node.js) and more libraries and frame-works such as STS, MongoDB, Mongoose, Bootstrap, JSP, DOM, AWS, Oracle SQL, Postman.
#### My interest in coding led me to start a new carrer and open doors to the new opportunities I have been "dream" about :)
