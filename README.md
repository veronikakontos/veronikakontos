### Hi there! My name is Veronika 
![](github.jpeg)

#### I'm a Full-stack Developer who is truly passionate about making open-source accessible, creating technology to elevate people, share ideas and building commmunity. My favorites technologies/languages I have been working with include ReactJS, MySql, Flask, MongoDb, Spring... I am ready and excited to excel my skills to the next level with knowledge and experiences with HTML5, CSS, Python, Java, MERN(mongo, express,react, node.js) and more libraries and frame-works such as STS, MongoDB, Mongoose, Bootstrap, JSP, DOM, AWS, Oracle SQL, Postman. My interest in coding led me to start a new carrer and open doors to the new opportunities I have "dream" about :)

### What do I do when I have Free time?
- I love traveling, visiting countries, exploring cities and learning about their cultures.
- I am animal lover! My favorite animal is cat ( I own 2 beautiful Maine-coons ♡).
- I like flowers and makes me happy to take care of my garden.
- I love to learn new stuff either is a new language or new cooking dish or handy stuff around the house.
